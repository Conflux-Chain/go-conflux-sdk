Smart Contracts
===============

Developers have the choice of two languages for writing smart contracts:

[Solidity](https://Solidity.readthedocs.io/)

> The flagship language of Ethereum, and most popular language for smart contracts.

LISP Like Language (LLL)

> A low level language, Serpent provides a superset of LLL. There's not a great deal of information for working with LLL, the following blog [/var/log/syrinx](http://blog.syrinx.net/) and associated [lll-resurrected GitHub](https://github.com/zigguratt/lll-resurrected) repository is a good place to start.

In order to deploy a smart contract onto the Ethereum blockchain, it must first be compiled into a bytecode format, then use [conflux-Abigen](../cfxabigen.md) to create contract binding for deploying and invoking with contract

## Examples
