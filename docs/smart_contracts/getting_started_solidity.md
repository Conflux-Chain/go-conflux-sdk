Getting started with Solidity
-----------------------------

An overview of Solidity is beyond the scope of these docs, however, the following resources are a good place to start:

-   [Introduction to Smart Contracts](http://Solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) in the Solidity project documentation
-   [Writing a contract](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/contracts.html#writing-a-contract) in the Ethereum Homestead Guide
